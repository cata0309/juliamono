### JuliaMono - a monospaced font for scientific and technical computing

JuliaMono is a monospaced typeface designed for programming in the [Julia](https://julialang.org) Programming Language and in other text editing environments that require a wide range of specialist and technical Unicode characters. It was intended as an experiment to be presented at the 2020 JuliaCon conference in Lisbon, Portugal (which of course was held online instead).

JuliaMono is:

- free
- distributed with a liberal licence
- suitable for scientific and technical programming as well as for general purpose hacking
- available for MacOS, Unix, and Windows
- easy to use, simple, friendly, and approachable
